/// The descent fails closed in exactly two cases: a block visited twice (a
/// cycle in `childHashes`) or a fork at which no non-excluded child is routed.
/// Neither can happen from a routed start point if the routed set is closed
/// under child edges and every child edge is parent-consistent and one height
/// down — a routed block's children are then routed, and no routed block can
/// be its own descendant. This asserts exactly that after every event of the
/// golden orders and (through the differential helpers) after every step of
/// the differential seeds, and descends from every routed block afterwards.
/// The reference walk that used to catch a broken invariant was deleted once
/// a temporary counter on every entry into it stayed zero over these runs.

/// Every routed block's children are all routed, parent-consistent and one
/// height above it, and its parent, when it has one, is routed.
