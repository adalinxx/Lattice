    /// height and timestamp:
    ///
    ///     target = anchorTarget * 2^((elapsed - targetBlockTime * heights) / halfLife)
    ///
    /// where `elapsed` is the time since the anchor and `heights` is the number
    /// of blocks since it. When the chain is exactly on schedule the exponent is
    /// zero and the target is the anchor's. Running ahead of schedule hardens
    /// it, running behind eases it, smoothly and without bound in either
    /// direction.
    ///
    /// **There is no window, and that is the point.** A windowed average carries
    /// its last intervals as state, so a stretch of unusual
    /// block times keeps steering difficulty long after it has passed, and a
    /// window perturbed at one end oscillates as it drains. This reads only the
    /// anchor and the present block, so it has nothing to drain: a disturbance
    /// stops mattering the moment it stops happening.
    ///
    /// It is also why the genesis timestamp cannot poison this schedule. A
    /// window that reaches back to genesis reads the gap before block 1 as one
    /// colossal solve time -- on a chain stamping genesis at epoch 0 that gap is
    /// decades, and the estimator eases every block until it finally ages out.
    /// Anchored at block 1, genesis is simply never read.
    ///
    /// The anchor must be a block whose target is near what the chain can
    /// actually sustain. This moves at most one doubling per half-life, so an
    /// anchor far from the truth is approached slowly -- from a maximum target
    /// that is dozens of half-lives, spent at negligible difficulty.
    ///
    /// Integer-exact by construction. Every node must compute the identical
    /// target from the identical inputs, so the exponential is evaluated in
    /// 16.16 fixed point with a cubic approximation over the fractional part --
    /// the same shape Bitcoin Cash's `aserti3-2d` uses, and for the same reason.
