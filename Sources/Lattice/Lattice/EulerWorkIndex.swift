/// every admission — O(depth) per event, and depth is chain length, which is
/// the quadratic in adalinxx/lattice-node#64.
///
/// Here no ancestor total is stored at all. Each block contributes two elements
/// to one sequence, an OPEN carrying its direct work and a CLOSE carrying zero,
/// and a block's subtree is exactly the contiguous run between them. A subtree
/// total is therefore a difference of prefix sums, and the ancestor walk is not
/// made cheaper, it ceases to exist: inserting a leaf, or splicing in a whole
/// grafted component, updates nothing above the insertion point, because every
/// enclosing range now contains the new elements by construction.
///
/// A Fenwick tree is the wrong shape for this one level up, even though the
/// library already uses one for direct work within an origin. Fenwick indexing
/// is defined over a dense static array; blocks arrive as leaves in the MIDDLE
/// of the tour, and a mid-array insert renumbers Θ(n) cells. The dynamic form
/// of "prefix sums over a sequence" is a balanced sequence tree, which is what
/// this is.
///
/// Balance is AVL. Its ±1 balance factor is a structural property of the
/// algorithm, not a tunable ceiling: there is no fanout, node size, load factor
/// or rebalance threshold to pick, so this introduces no configurable number.
/// The tree is INSERT-ONLY — nothing is ever removed from fork choice, an
/// exclusion included (work weighs, §9.9) — which removes the hardest half of
/// the implementation and every case that would need one.
