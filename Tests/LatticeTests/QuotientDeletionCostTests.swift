/// The shape the segment quotient was BUILT for: a long fork-free run, where
/// one segment spans the whole chain and a hop replaces a per-block walk.
///
/// Deleting a structure makes "nothing got slower" trivially true on any shape
/// that never built it, so a merged-mining shape cannot answer whether the
/// deletion cost anything — there the quotient was already degenerate, one
/// segment per block. This is the shape where it was doing real work, and it is
/// measured on the code BEFORE the deletion and again after, so the comparison
/// is a number rather than an argument.
///
/// Two costs are separated because they behave differently:
///   - steady state, where every admission extends the tip and the projection
///     descends only from the divergence point;
///   - the forced whole-chain projection, reached here through an exclusion,
///     which is the one path that still walks from the root and therefore the
///     only place a quotient hop was load-bearing.
