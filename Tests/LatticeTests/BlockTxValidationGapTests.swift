// BTV-A1: unavailable evidence vs permanent rejection at admission.
//   admitBlockHeaderChainLocal must report `.unavailableEvidence` when block
//   content cannot be resolved because of a *transient* fetch failure (the data
//   is re-requestable and a later attempt succeeds), while a genuinely-invalid
//   but fully-resolvable block must be permanently rejected on reprocessing.
//   Exercised through the real chain-local admission entry point with an
//   injectable resolution-failing Fetcher.
//
// BTV-A2: a leaf-chain withdrawal whose deposit exists (so block building /
//   mempool accounting succeeds) but which has NO corresponding receipt in the
//   parent-chain frontier at apply must be REJECTED by withdrawalsAreValid —
//   the check deferred to block validation actually fires. Exercised through the
//   real Block.validateNexus entry point (the per-process child validation path).
